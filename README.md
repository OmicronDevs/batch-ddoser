**Q:** Why the Dooser looks too *ugly* (no design)?

**A:** I ALEREADY HAVE FINISHED IT (With colors, more functions, stronger or custom pings, DDoS power and things like this), BUT I AM CHANGING MY PC's DRIVES, SO I CAN'T UPLOAD IT. PLEASE WATCH THIS REPOSITORY AND STAR IT!

UPDATE TO RELEASE 1.0 SOON!! ü§°
